# Go News

## Overview
Sometimes, we want to subscribe to an important news or get a certain post on a web but unfortunately, it doesn't provide "subscribe" option. GoNews tries to solve it by search certain keywords and send you the email once the content appears on the website. This repository is using Golang.
